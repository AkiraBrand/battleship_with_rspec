What I learned TO do:

Run Rspec from the root directory

Google the exact error message you are getting right away if you have never seen it before


What I learned NOT to do:

Try to figure out the fix to an unknown never seen before error message with no reference for 40 minutes

Run Rspec from not the root directory

Make wonky file structures
